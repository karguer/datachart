<!-- STORY -->
<h5> By Karina Guerrero </h5>
<!-- DATELINE -->
<h5> November 12, 2021 </h5>

<p> Bronx Community Board 8 includes membership dating back to the late 1970s when the district was predominantly white. Since then, these neighborhoods have undergone significant demographic shifts.</p>

<p> Now members—old and new—are questioning how their majority white board can better advocate for the communities they serve through advisory votes to the City Council and other elected representatives. </p>

<p> In 2020, a Special Committee for Racial Equity was formed on the board and reported the district has “grown more Hispanic, slightly more African American, and significantly less white during the past decade.” </p>

<p> “The board is starting to look more closely at itself and where we are pushing for resources in the district,” says newer board member Margaret Della.</p>

<p> In September, the board welcomed six new members, six of which are members of color. “We really need new blood,” says board Chairperson Laura Spalter, who's served on the board for 27 years. </p>
